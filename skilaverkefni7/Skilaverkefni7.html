        The last generations of graphics cards compared <br> to the new ones.

        The <span class="color"> GeForce 2080 and the 2000 series cards</span> where the first cards to introduce the <span class="color"> RTX </span> technology. <br>
         Which renders shadows and colors a lot better then the older <span class="color"> GTX </span> generation cards. Not only did <span class="color"> they <br> render shadows better they also opened for more mirroring. </span> For an example in game when a player <br> 
         would look at water, they would see their <span class="color"> reflection. </span> The technology itself is very complicated and hard <br> to master. <span class="color"> When the 2000 series card </span> came out, they weren´t cheap. But there was a good reason for that.

        <section></section> <div> <span class="green"> Later, the new 3000 series <br> </span> cards came out and they shocked the whole world not only the gamers but every computer fan out there. The <span class="color"> ray tracing technology </span> was so new at the time that no would have thought they would top the <span class="color"> 2000 series cards </span>. 
            When the <span class="color"> 3000 </span> was first put in stocks it was priced at almost only half the price of the 2000 series and this made a lot of <span class="color"> GeForce </span> fans very mad or annoyed. 
            The lunch price for the <span class="color"> 2080ti </span> was 1,199 thousand dollars and the <span class="color"> 3080 </span> at only 649 hundred dollars which is a huge gap. Later in the lunch for the <span class="color">3000 </span> series the pricing would go up. 
            The production was slow, and everyone had to wait for their cards sooner or later the price would be very similar to the <span class="color"> 2080ti </span> card.
             But if you would find a gaming store that sells the <span class="color"> 2080 </span>, they would sell it for more than the new cards. There was a lot of attention to the pricing but also to the <span class="color"> performance </span> of the brand new card. 
             The <span class="color"> 3080ti </span> would shoot ahead of the 2080ti and be a 38% upgrade which is huge.  The <span class="color"> 3070ti </span> one below <span class="color"> 3080ti </span> would only be 3% behind the <span class="color"> 2080ti </span> and would be around 150 dollars cheaper if you would buy it now.</div> </section></center>

        <div class="hæð">Owner and the founders of the company <br> <span class="hæð2">Nvidia was founded in the year 1993 by a men named <span class="color"> Jensen Huang, Chris Malachowsky and Curtis Priem.</span>
             With their beliefs they were sure that in the future <span class="color"> games would be one of the biggest industries for computers </span> and they wanted to make gaming as beautiful as they could.
              <span class="color"> By the year 2006 Nividia was the only independent still operating </span>.  In the 1994 they partnered with their first company SGS-Thomson so thei could <span class="color"> produce the single-chip graphical user interface accelerator </span>.
               The first ever product came in the year 1995 <span class="color"> NV1 </span>. Sega used this card for 3d games. Nvidia <span class="color"> product called RIVA 128 lunched the year 1997 and sold 1million units </span> in the first 4 months. But now known as a GPU was invented in the year 1999. 
               The first ever <span class="color"> Xbox console partnered with Nvidia, </span> and they used their GPU the year 2000. Many years pass and they partner with bunch of other companies for an example the ps3 used their graphics. 
               Now there are about <span class="color"> 23 years since the first GPU </span> and in this short time game quality has improved drastically. </span></div>

<div class="hæð2"> <span class="green"> Nvidia users <br> </span><span class="text2">Nvidia users are mostly from two categories one people who play <span class="color"> high demanding video games and the other for high demanding video editing or photoshop </span>.
     The Nvidia company supports both kind of users and offers GPU drivers for <span class="color"> gamers or editing </span>. Most of schools that have high demanding <span class="color"> computer science have their Graphical processing device </span>.
      Not only schools also places where you can pay to play their devices. Arena is a company in Iceland where people come together and play and all of their computers all have the <span class="color">3080ti the best of the old gen GPU </span>.
      The future looks very bright for the users and the company as they keep producing and doing their best. Every new gen of their GPU seems to surprise and the Users now have never been more <span class="color"> happier </span>.  </span> </div>
